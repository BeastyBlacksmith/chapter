**Regular's table**

Since November 3, 2021, we use the same days as the [SIGDIUS (Special Interest Group Data Infrastructure) Seminar](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/events/workshops/sigdius-seminars/), to meet up for a small and informal regular's table. When COVID allows, we typically meet at [Unithekle](https://www.unithekle.de/) in the evening. Details are fixed during the seminar. Everybody interested in RSE is welcome to join.
