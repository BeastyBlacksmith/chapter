# Welcome to Wue-RSE!

Welcome to the web page of the Würzburg Chapter of DE-RSE!
We are an open group of people at the university of Würzburg
who care about Software, Research and especially about Research Software.
We strive to offer an equal platform for scientists of all fields
in sharing their knowledge and experience.

We currently meet monthly within our established Hacky Hour format.

Geographically we currenly focus on the university of Würzburg,
but people from any other part of the Franconias are welcome, too!

We are excited to hear about you and your ideas!

Discussion currently happens on our Discord channel, please contact us if you want to get an invite.

## RSE related local initiatives

### Hacky Hour Würzburg
The HackyHour serves as our monthly meeting.

Why should you visit us?
- If you want to talk about science in a social environment.
- If you want to know how computational tools and code can improve your science
- If you just want to drink a (virtual) beer: join us! We strive to be an open and inclusive community, everyone is welcome!

Find more information about the next date at its [HackyHour Website](http://hackyhour.github.io/Wuerzburg/)

### Software Carpentry
We regularly do software carpentry workshops ehere we teach basic computational skills
(unix bash, pythin, version control with git)
for researchers. For past and future courses have a look at
our [github site](https://github.com/swcarpentry-wuerzburg/chapter) 
but also make sure to check the official [software carpentry sites](https://software-carpentry.org/)

### Code development and optimization: harnessing the power of massively parallel computer architectures
We strive to help you unlock the computational potential of your code in todays
multi-platform computing environments.

If you want to know what code optimization 
can do for your code get in [touch](fgoth@physik.uni-wuerzburg.de)!

There's also a website internal to the university [here](z03.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de).

### Data Management
We are currently working on setting up collaborative data management solutions for the cluster of 
excellence ct.qmat. If you want to participate in our experiences,
get [in touch](https://www.ctqmat.de/en/research/data-management)!
