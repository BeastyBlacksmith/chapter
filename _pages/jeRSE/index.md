Welcome to the website for **jeRSE**, the regional chapter of [de-RSE](https://de-rse.org) in and around [Jena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena).
_jeRSE is an open group of people from the area who care about research software._

We meet every second Wednesday each month at 1 pm in the local hackspace, [Krautspace](https://kraut.space/).
We start each meeting with a 5 minute impulse introduction to a topic of choice for that month, but afterwards there its time for open discussion on anything we/you want to talk about.

## Next meeting

We will hold the next meeting on **2022-11-09 at 1pm**.
The impulse topic: Writing plug-ins for LimeSurvey.
